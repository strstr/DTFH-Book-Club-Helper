   <body> 
	  The Definitive Duncan Trussel Family Hour Book Club (Dune Edition) Page-Synchronization Solver is a tool uniquely designed to maximize the enjoyment of the DTFH:Book Club. If, like many, you ask yourself "I have a different edition of Dune!! what does reading the next 70 pages MEAN?!? LIFE IS CHAOS!!" , you have come to the bestest and rightest of places. BEHOLD AND FEAR NOT! your problem has been solved by the futuristic technomagical interwebbed computation god machine (and basic algebra)  </div> 
	  
	  <div>
	  <p>
	  <p>
	  FIRST, enter the page number, or number of pages, that Duncan expresses. THEN, in the SECOND box, enter the total amount of pages of YOUR version. 
	  
	  click the button and BEHOLD as the power invested in your web browser proclaims the TRUTH! (if and only if you are truthful to it yourself)
	  
	  <div>
	  <p>
	  <p>
	  <h3>page number / number of pages
	  <div><input type="number" value="70" id="duncan_dune_page_number"/>
	  
	  <div>
	  <p>
	  <p>
	  <h3>total number of pages in my version (or 100 if you are on kindle)
	  <div><input type="number" id="my_total_pages"/>
	  
	  <div>
	  <input type="button" value="COMPUTATE" onclick="solve()"/>
	  
	  <div>
	  	  <p>
	  <p>
	  <p>
	  <h3>
	  THE COMPUTED CORRESPONDANCE IS : 
	  <input type="number" value="" id="result"/>

	  
	  <div>
	  <p>
	  <p>
	  BEWARE!! Duncan's edition is ALL Dune books combined into a single book, UP TO but not including Dune Messiah. BEWARE that there are editions published where Dune is split into two or even three books, THEREFORE the magical formula will fail unless you tweak it accordingly. a brave mathemancer can solve that with a judicious division by 2 or 3.
	  
	  now, of COURSE there can be imprecisions, but it should be accurate enough to roughly spot chapters, with maybe an error of a couple of pages
